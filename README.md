#Welcome to ProseMeteor.
ProseMeteor is a package integrating [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) and [Meteor.js](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/).
ProseMeteor is built for Meteor 1.3+

#Goals
The primary goal is to provide a package that provides realtime collaborative WYSIWYG editing.

Discussion for the ProseMeteor project will take place on Humon [ProseMeteor Wiki](https://humon.com/Prosemeteor/RJsnS9dyAH8k6cuma/Home/STisHoM8MxcqgTxGw)

The wiki is readable by everyone but if you would like to contribute please contact funkyeah@gmail.com for an invite.

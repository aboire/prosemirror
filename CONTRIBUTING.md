# Contributing Guidelines
The process for making changes to the code base looks like this

1. For any significant changes, please make a GitHub issue so others can see your proposed change, discuss it, and track its progress.
2. If you haven't done so, fork the repository. All of your changes should go in your fork.
3. When it's time to do work, assign the corresponding issue to yourself on GitHub, then create a new branch and name it correctly for the changes to be done.
   1. Acceptable branch name prefixes are

     * "feature/" - for a feature tracked by an issue
     * "dev/" - for minor dev work
     * "test/" - for adding tests
     * "fix/" - for fixing a problem
   2. Example: I've created Issue #5 "Add option to change the snapshot interval". I would assign #5 to myself, then create a new branch in my fork called "feature/snapshot-interval-option"

4. Once your work is complete, push your changes up to your fork and create a pull request back to the main repository. Make sure to mention the corresponding issue in the pull request if there is one.
5. Wait for others to review your changes.
6. Once changes are approved, the pull request can be merged.
